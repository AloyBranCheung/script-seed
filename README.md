## Developer Notes

* Serving async requests over the `file://` protocol will not work in a browser.
  Use a [local test server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server)
  to develop this project locally. For example, `python3 -m http.server` or
  `python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer`.
