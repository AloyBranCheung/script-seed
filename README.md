# Script Seed

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mkasberg/script-seed.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mkasberg/script-seed)

ðŸŒ± Seed scripts for popular (and unpopular) scripting languages.

Visit the **[website](https://mkasberg.github.io/script-seed/)** to find a
sample script in your favorite language. The idea is to give you just enough
boilerplate code to parse command line arguments and give you a sense of how the
language works.


## Contributing

Script Seed needs **your** help! Please contribute by:

 * Adding a new scripting language. I want to include _everything_ that can be
   run on Ubuntu with a `#!` line.
 * Improving existing script seeds. Each seed should be an example of best
   practices in the given language.
 * Improving the look, feel, and usability of the [GitHub pages
   site](https://mkasberg.github.io/script-seed/).

See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info.

## Developer Environment Setup

You'll have the best experience on macOS or Linux. On Windows, some scripts will
work if you have the appropriate language installed. Regardless of your
platform, you'll probably find running scripts and/or the site itself inside a
Docker container to be the best experience unless you're working with a single
script that you can easily test yourself.

A Makefile is provided so you can get started quickly with Docker. For example,
simply run `make shell` to get an interactive prompt with all our supported
languages available. You can leave that shell open to test your scripts while
you edit them on the host machine in your favorite IDE.

    $ make
    Usage: make [target]

    Targets:
      help   Print this help message.
      image  Build the script-seed:latest Docker image.
      test   Run the test suite inside a Docker container.
      server Serve the website.
      shell  Open a shell inside the Docker container for manual testing.
      clean  Remove the Docker image.
